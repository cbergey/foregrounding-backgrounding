General info: Use guided access on the iPad and make sure you always use headphones with the kids. The experiment should take less than five minutes. It may take a few seconds to load the first page of the experiment and the page with the orange button; this is normal.

Beginning of the day: Please run the experiment at least once at the beginning of the day to make sure it’s working. Use participant number 0 (zero) and age 0 (zero) when you do test runs of the experiment. Use the headphones and make sure the sound is working and is loud enough during the videos and the selection slides. (You should hear an exchange like “Is that a wug?” “No” and then “Find the wug” on the selection page.) If it’s not working, please text me at (301) 655-9739 or email me at cbergey@uchicago.edu .

Recruiting: We’re recruiting kids age 3–6 for this experiment.
</p>

<p class="block-text">
Consent forms: Make sure to have the parent/guardian fill out the normal consent form. Put the experiment code FBV1 and the participant number on each consent form.
</p>

<p class="block-text">
Pre-experiment: Make sure to put the kid’s age and their participant numbers in the relevant slot on the first webpage of the experiment. (Again, use zeros for participant ID and age if you’re doing a test run.) Read the instructions on the first page to the participant. Then make sure they’re seated and have the headphones on snugly. Hit next, and an orange button should come up; tell the participant to tap the orange button to start whenever they’re ready. If the participant looks to you, hesitates, or has a hard time typing the iPad, give them general encouragement but don’t push them toward any particular response.

Post-experiment: When the screen goes black, the experiment is over. Tell the kid good job and give them a sticker!

Thank you!</p>
